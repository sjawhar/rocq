# The -o summary refuses where its walk of the module implementations
# (checker/mod_impl.ml) stops. A library coqc writes reaches only the walk's
# two bounds (misc/rocqchk_application_bound_summary.sh); every other stop
# needs a shape coqc does not write, which an admitted library can hold,
# since rocqchk does not check it. forge.ml writes each such shape into a
# copy of the honest Stops.v, one shape to a copy, and rocqchk -o must refuse
# each copy with that stop's error:
#   alias-cycle             Self := Self
#   implementation-cycle    Up := Down and Down := Up.C: the module Up is
#                           needed while Up is read
#   functor-implementation  NotF, which is not a functor, gets a functor's
#                           expression
#   with-functor            RW applies a 'with' constraint
#   expression-arguments    Gexpr's expression binds two parameters, and its
#                           type has one
#   path-chain              Chain.M := Chain and Chain.G (X : S) := X.M.G X.M:
#                           RC := Chain.G Chain resolves Chain.M...M.G with one
#                           more M at each step
#   argument-chain          G := G A: RG := G A resolves G with one argument
#                           more at each step
# Both chains end at the step bound, in time. Their errors are matched by a
# pattern, since the length of the path or the number of arguments depends
# on the steps taken. The stop where an application's arguments do not fit
# its functor's parameters is the one misc/rocqchk_functor_loop_summary.sh
# reaches. The honest library is the control: rocqchk -o lists the axiom ax
# of F's body under RC, RE and RW.
