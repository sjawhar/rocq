# The -o summary reads a functor application through its functor's body
# (checker/mod_impl.ml), and the applications in that body in turn. rocqchk
# does not check an admitted library, so its functor's body can apply that
# functor again, which coqc never writes: forge.ml makes F's body in the
# honest Loop.v hold Grow := F Loc and Same := F X. In F's body read as
# R := F A, F's own path names R, so the walk reads Grow, which comes first,
# as R's expression F A applied to R.Loc as well: one argument more than F
# takes. It cannot read that application, so rocqchk -o must end, and refuse
# to print a summary, with an error that names it. The honest library is the
# control: it lists R.ax alone.
