# Shared helpers of the fork's misc tests that read the summary of
# rocqchk -o: rocqchk_admitted_summary.sh, rocqchk_sealed_axiom_summary.sh,
# rocqchk_ascribed_axiom_summary.sh, rocqchk_application_axiom_summary.sh,
# rocqchk_application_bound_summary.sh, rocqchk_alias_cycle_summary.sh,
# rocqchk_functor_loop_summary.sh, rocqchk_cook.sh and
# rocqchk_primitive_type.sh. Each sources it with
#
#   . misc/rocqchk_summary_common.bash
#
# so that a change of the summary's format is made here for them. Upstream's
# assumptions-norec.sh keeps its own reader, as upstream wrote it.
#
# This file is deliberately not named *.sh: the misc target runs every
# misc/*.sh as a test of its own (see the "misc:" rule in test-suite/Makefile).
# That rule exports $BIN and runs the script from the test-suite directory;
# it does not export a rocqchk command, so rocqchk is spelled "$BIN"rocqchk.
