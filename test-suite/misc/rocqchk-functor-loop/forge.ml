(* Give Loop.vo the functor coqc refuses to write: in the body of F, the
   modules Grow and Same, applications of G in the honest file, become
   applications of F itself.
     Grow := F Loc,  Same := F X
   The type of R := F A is F's body substituted, and the substitution keeps
   the unchanged head of each application, MEident G, as the very block of
   F's body, so R's Grow and Same share F's heads. The forgery gives both
   the same new heads, so R's type says F too. The file is rewritten in
   place.

   The helpers, and the value layouts they rely on, are those of
   misc/rocqchk_forge_lib.ml. This file adds checker/values.ml's layouts of
   what an Algebraic implementation holds, [expression], of an expression
   MENoFunctor (tag 0) [algebraic expression], of an algebraic expression
   MEident (tag 0) [module path] | MEapply (tag 1) [head; argument], and of
   a module path MPfile (tag 0) [dirpath] | MPbound (tag 1) | MPdot (tag 2)
   [module path; label]. Each block is checked to have the expected shape
   before it is used.
