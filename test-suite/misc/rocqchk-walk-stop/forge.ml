(* Give Stops.vo one of the shapes coqc refuses to write, each a stop of
   the -o walk (checker/mod_impl.ml). Stops.v says which modules each shape
   changes:
     alias-cycle             Self := Self
     implementation-cycle    Up := Down, Down := Up.C
     functor-implementation  NotF := (functor) Defines
     with-functor            RW := (F with Module ... := A) A
     expression-arguments    Gexpr := (functor) (functor) F X
     path-chain              Chain.M := Chain, Chain.G := (functor) X.M.G X.M
     argument-chain          G := G A
   The file is rewritten in place. The helpers, and the value layouts they
   rely on, are those of misc/rocqchk_forge_lib.ml. This file adds
   checker/values.ml's layouts of what an Algebraic implementation (tag 0)
   holds, [expression]; of an expression MENoFunctor (tag 0) [algebraic
   expression] | MEMoreFunctor (tag 1) [expression]; of an algebraic
   expression MEident (tag 0) [module path] | MEapply (tag 1) [algebraic
   expression; module path] | MEwith (tag 2) [algebraic expression;
   with_declaration]; of a with_declaration WithMod (tag 0) [label list;
   module path]; and of a module path MPfile (tag 0) [dirpath] | MPbound
   (tag 1) [bound name] | MPdot (tag 2) [module path; label]. Each block is
   checked to have the expected shape before it is used.
